      <h2>Javascript project for practice</h2>
      <p>
        Here’s a really simple (not easy) project that will get you through all
        the basic tools you would use in most projects. Try it with vanilla js
        but if you need a little help, use jquery
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Create a form with a single input and a submit button. Enter text,
          press submit. Make the text appear below the form. Add text, submit,
          change what’s below.
        </li>
        <li>
          now make it so every time you add text and hit submit, it adds the
          text on a line below the previous
        </li>
        <li>now add a line counter that displays how many lines are there.</li>
        <li>now make it so when you click a line of text, it disappears.</li>
        <li>
          now (if you haven’t done it previously) change your structure to work
          by adding your text to an array and outputting the array as lines of
          text below the form. Have your counter show the length of the array
          rather than just incrementing.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Congrats. You just did all the basics of DOM manipulation using arrays
        to control content.
      </p>

      <p>
        All of these are small tasks, but they are the skills that you’ll use in
        any project. If you’re not sure how to do something, google is your
        friend. Use stack overflow.
      </p>

      <form id="textTest">
        <input id="userInput" type="text" placeholder="Enter your text here" />
        <input type="button" onclick="addItem()" value="Submit" />
      </form>
      <div id="arrayOutput"></div>
      <div id="textTarget"></div>
      <div id="counter"></div>
    
    </div>
